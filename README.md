# Vehicle Data
This repo contains satellite images with labels for the vehicles.  It is structured into two sub-directories with labelled and un-labelled images in each respectively.  The labling tool can be used to add labels into the unlablled directory as `.txt` files. Run the sort script to move the labelled data into the correct folder automatically.

```bash
sudo bash ./sort_data_script
```
